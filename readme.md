# Crack Annotation Guidelines

Welcome to the crack annotation guide for our "Basic Crack Detector" project! This document will walk you through the process of annotating images with cracks, helping ensure we get high-quality data for our crack detection system.

## Overview

In our project, we need to annotate cracks in wall images. Each annotation will be a binary mask where:
- **0** indicates "no-crack" (background)
- **255** indicates "crack" (foreground)

## How to Annotate

### 1. Choosing Your Images

- **Focus:** Look for cracks in walls. Please avoid pavement cracks, artwork, or any other surfaces not specified.
- **Size Matters:** Include both small and large cracks. The goal is to capture a variety of crack sizes.

### 2. Annotation Tools

- **Tools to Use:** I recommend using GIMP or the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT). These tools are great for precision.
- **Drawing Tips:**
  - Use a fine brush or pencil tool to carefully trace around each crack.
  - Zoom in to make sure youâ€™re accurately capturing the edges.
  - Avoid adding extra width or extending beyond the actual crack.

### 3. Step-by-Step Annotation

1. **Load the Image:** Open your image in the chosen annotation tool.
2. **Draw the Mask:**
   - Select a thin brush size.
   - Carefully trace the visible cracks. Make sure to cover all parts of the crack.
3. **Review and Save:**
   - Double-check your work for completeness and accuracy.
   - Save your mask in the same dimensions as the original image (e.g., PNG format).

### 4. Dealing with Uncertainties

- **If in Doubt:** If you're unsure whether something is a crack or a shadow, it's safer to annotate it as "no-crack."
- **Reference Examples:** Feel free to look at provided example annotations for guidance on typical crack appearances and boundaries.

## Ensuring Quality

- **Review Regularly:** Check your annotations for consistency and accuracy.
- **Get a Second Opinion:** Have someone else review the annotations to spot any errors.
- **Test Early:** Use a portion of your annotated data to test initial models and identify any issues with the annotations.
